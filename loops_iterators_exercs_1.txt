What does the each method in the following program return after it is finished executing?

  x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  x.each do |a|
    a + 1
  end

Answer: The array will be returned in its original form
        because the #each method doesn't chang the array.
        So the do/end code block is executed, but it doesn't
        change the array.
