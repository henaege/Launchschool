NameError: undefined local variable or method `shoes' for main:Object
  from (irb):3
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

  This error tells me that the variable (or method) 'shoes' was either never defined, or is being called from a different scope than which it was created.
