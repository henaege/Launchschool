What will the following program output?

  hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
  hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}

  if hash1 == hash2
    puts "These hashes are the same!"
  else
    puts "These hashes are not the same!"
  end

We should get "These hashes are the same!" because each key-value pair matches. Order doesn't matter because it's a hash and not an array.
