1. '4' == 4 ? puts("TRUE") : puts("FALSE")

  My Answer: FALSE (comparing a string to an int)
  Real Answer: FALSE

2. x = 2
   if ((x * 3) / 2) == (4 + 4 - x - 3)
     puts "Did you get it right?"
   else
     puts "Did you?"
   end

  My Answer: "Did you get it right?"
  Real Answer: "Did you get it right?"

3. y = 9
   x = 10
   if (x + 1) <= (y)
     puts "Alright."
   elsif (x + 1) >= (y)
     puts "Alright now!"
   elsif (y + 1) == (x)
     puts "ALRIGHT NOW!"
   else
     puts "Alrighty!"
   end

  My Answer: "Alright now!" (the first elsif statement evaluates
    to true, so the rest of the block is skipped)
  Real Answer: "Alright now!"
