You run the following code...

  names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
  names['margaret'] = 'jody'

...and get the following error message:

  TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

What is the problem and how can it be fixed?

  The problem is you are trying to change a value in the array
  by accessing the value, not the index. Instead, do:

    names[3] = 'jody'

  This will replace the value at index 3 with the new value.
