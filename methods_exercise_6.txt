ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

This error message tells me that the method expects 2
arguents when it is called, but only 1 argument was passed
to the caller.
