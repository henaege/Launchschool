Given the following code...

  x = "hi there"

  my_hash = {x: "some value"}
  my_hash2 = {x <= "somevalue"}

What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

THe only difference is my_hash was created using x as a symbol for the
key, while my_hash2 was created using x as a string for the key.
